## Projects
- [Alphabet](https://github.com/andrei-dragan/operating-systems-project1) - implemented a C program the simulates a game where children tell the letters of the alphabet in a circle, with a random chance of changing the order, using **processes** and **pipes** to communicate between them.
- [Contest](https://github.com/andrei-dragan/operating-systems-project2) - implemented a C program the simulates the process of choosing the winners for a contest, while restricting the numbers of **concurrent** users that may check the winners at some point, using **threads** together with **mutexes**, **conditional variables** and **semaphores** as **synchronization mechanisms**.
